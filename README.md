# Project on DIAMOND data set

## Introduction
This project was done using a classic diamond dataset which I got from Kaggle. 
The dataset had almost 54000 entries each representing the price in dollars and other physical attributes unique for each stone. 
It was a csv file made up of 10 columns with data types such as text and numbers. The dataset aroused my interest as I knew nothing about diamonds and what to look out for if I had to acquire one. It was interesting to see what the industry requirements are for the precious stones.

##Tools  for data analysis
I used Excel and Powerbi to analyze the data and to create interactive dash board as visualizations. It was very informative to see that the tool of analysis does not influence the outcome but validates the derived insights as there were similar insights on the different tools.
