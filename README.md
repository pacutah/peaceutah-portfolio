# Project on Diamond data set

##**Introduction**

This project was executed  using a classic diamond dataset which I  downloaded from Kaggle. 
The dataset had almost 54000 entries each representing the price in dollars and other physical attributes unique for each stone. 
It was a csv file made up of 10 columns with data types such as text and numbers. The dataset aroused my interest as I knew nothing about diamonds and what to look out for if I had to acquire one. It was interesting to see what the industry requirements are for the precious stones.

##Tools  for data analysis

I used Excel for data cleaning and exploratory analysis while PowerBI was used to analyze the data and to create interactive dashboard as visualizations. It was very informative to see that the tool of analysis does not influence the outcome but validates the derived insights as there were similar insights on the different tools.

##Analysis and Insights

The collection of diamonds positioned for sale was consistent with industry standards where there was a good interplay of the relevant diamond rating factors.
In general, the diamonds were  predominantly small stones ranging between  0.2 – 5.01 carats and about 95% were between 0.00- 1.99 carats, while 4%  were between 2.0 -3.0 carats  and the remaining  less than 1% were 3.0 and above.
The total weight  of the stones in the data set was 43,042.99 carats.
The value of the transaction was $212,143,486.
The depth profile of the diamonds was in the ideal range for most of the stones across the categories where 0.00- 3.00 carats had ideal depth range 59.5 % - 62.9% while the bigger stones above 3.0 carats had permissible range. It was observed that average depth increased with carat.
The colour profile was consistent with desired standard covering only from alphabet D – J. G colour  was the most common in the dataset having  the highest cumulative carat.
Clarity had an uneven spread across the spectrum, where 79% were spread between VS1,VS2.SI1,SI2  as 41.3% of the diamonds were slightly included  SI1 and SI2 which  are not the ideal rating  and the37.7% were VS1, and VS2 and the remaining  21% were spread among the remaining items on the scale. This property had the worst profile because the best clarity rating factors were barely up 20%. 
The cut which is the most important  factor had an impressive profile where, over 96% of the diamonds were between ideal and good rating  which is consistent with industry expectations. The impressive cut profile made up for the average clarity rating where 40% of the stones had ideal cut rating. 
It was observed that were all other rating factors remained same, price would increase as carat weight increase.
Working with both Excel and PowerBI  showed that the tool used for analysis may vary but the derived insights wod be similar where the riht conditions are engaged.


##Limitations

The table was not included in the data analysis because  information about shape of the diamond was not included in the dataset and  ideal table ranges vary with shape of stone, hence inability to perform such analysis
